seGmail stands for Secure Gmail. This will help you keep your mails private.

== What is seGmail

    seGmail is an attempt to bring back your privacy. Essentially, seGmail is a platform which encrypts all mails you send through seGmail clients so that only the sender and the recipient of the mail/message can understand it.
    
== Why seGmail

    We know Google reads and analyses all our mails we send through Gmail. This also enables the "quick reply" feature Gmail has. We are working to make your life better.

== How seGmail works

    We're still working on it. ;-)

Will be shared in detail in this page.
